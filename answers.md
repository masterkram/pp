## Exercise 1

a. In this case it is better to switch the choice.
Switching provides an expectation of 0.666 of success while
not switching leads to 0.333.

b. In this case it is also better to switch the door choice.
Switching provides an expectation of 0.666 while not switching leads to 0.333 expectation.

c. In this case it does not matter the choice of switching or not switching
the expectation is always 0.333.

## Exercise 2

a. To ensure a win with above 70%, we must use 23 coins (70.04% probability of win)
b. The expected number of rounds is 24.83

## Exercise 3

a. expected value 3D10: 7.975
b. The ratios are for n = [2, 3, 4]
are: 0,69125, 0,774375, 0,824166875
The rough pattern that we can recognize is that
the ratios are increasing but the value of the increase of
each step is roughly half of the previous increase.
c.

$\int_x^{+\infty}x(3x^2-3x+1)dx$

$\int_x^{+\infty}(3x^3-3x^2+x)dx$

$|\frac{3}{4}x^4-x^3+\frac{1}{2}x^2|_0^{+\infty}$
